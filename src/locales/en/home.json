		"title": "Thai Solution Massage",
		"paragraph1": "Thai Solution Massage represents centuries of healing wisdom passed down by Thai masters. This sophisticated therapeutic approach works with your body's natural energy lines—the 'Sen' channels that connect to your nervous system and overall wellbeing. Through skilled manipulation using appropriate pressure and body weight, our therapists stimulate deep tissues, promote profound relaxation, and restore balance where conventional massage often falls short.",
		"paragraph2": "Especially beneficial for chronic conditions that haven't responded to other treatments: migraines, tennis elbow, persistent muscular pain, knee arthritis, calf cramps, and plantar fasciitis. Rather than following one-size-fits-all protocols, our Thailand-trained therapists read your body's individual indicators and adapt their technique accordingly. The result is authentic, personalised therapeutic care that addresses your specific needs and helps your body function as it should.",

			"text": "I've suffered with lower back pain for years from my office job. After just two sessions of deep tissue massage at Sabai, I noticed a massive difference.

		"topper": "FAQs",
		"title": "Your Questions About Thai Massage Answered",
		"imageAlt": "Sabai Thai Spa treatment room showcasing tranquil atmosphere and professional setup",
		"question1": "What happens during my first appointment?",
		"answer1": "You'll meet your therapist who will discuss your health, any problem areas, and what you'd like to achieve from treatment. After this brief consultation, you'll change into comfortable clothing we provide. Your therapist will then perform your chosen massage, checking in about pressure and comfort. The whole experience is relaxed and professional—first-timers always tell us they felt immediately at ease.",
		"question2": "How long are the massage sessions?",
		"answer2": "We offer 60-minute and 90-minute treatments. These times refer to actual hands-on massage—we don't include consultation or dressing time in your session length. A 60-minute session works well for targeting specific areas, whilst 90 minutes allows for full-body treatment or deeper therapeutic work on multiple problem areas.",
		"question3": "Should I book in advance or can I walk in?",
		"answer3": "Advance booking is recommended, particularly for weekend and evening appointments when we're busiest. You can check availability and book instantly through our online system—it's available 24/7 and shows you real-time appointment slots. We occasionally have same-day availability, especially during weekday mornings and early afternoons.",
		"question4": "What should I wear to my appointment?",
		"answer4": "Come in whatever you're wearing—we provide comfortable, loose-fitting clothing for your treatment. Thai massage is traditionally done clothed (unlike oil massage), so you'll wear the outfit we provide. There's no need to bring anything special. Everything you need is provided, including fresh towels.",
		"question5": "What's your policy on cancellations?",
		"answer5": "We ask for at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. With sufficient notice, we'll move your appointment to a time that suits you better, completely free of charge. Cancellations made with less than 24 hours' notice may be subject to a cancellation fee. You can manage your bookings anytime through our online system."
